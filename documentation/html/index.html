<p>In this system, the users can assume that there are no numbering error in the file, and the file will always be in the same directory as the program. In the Voting System Software, the users can enter the prompt command in the keyboard.</p>

<p><a class="el" href="classCandidate.html" title="Candidate is an entity participating in the election.

Party</h1>
<p>According to wikipedia.or, <a class="el" href="classParty.html" title="A Party mainly holds instances of Candidates. It also contains some variables for seat distribution c...">Party</a> is a political party that organized group of people who have the same ideology, or who otherwise have the same political positions, and who field candidates for elections, in an attempt to get them elected and thereby implement the party's agenda (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_party">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_party</a>). In our Voting System, there are five parties, such as Democratic, Republican, Reform, Green, and Independent <a class="el" href="classCandidate.html" title="Candidate is an entity participating in the election. It holds vote information when it&#39;s Open Party ...">Candidate</a>. In the party's class, the system can access the information for each parties with the list of candidates and the name of each party. In this class, the system be able to get access the number of of seats, number of votes and number of candidates. Also, we implement the functions that can add the candidate into the list of candidate and add the ballot id into the list of ballot id.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="cpl"></a>
CPL</h1>
<p><a class="el" href="classCPL.html" title="Closed Party List voting. Inherits VotingType. This voting method votes only to parties. So, Candidate objects will not recieve any votes. Party will recieve the votes instead. This is informed to the Report class for Displaying results. ">CPL</a> stands for Closed <a class="el" href="classParty.html" title="A Party mainly holds instances of Candidates. It also contains some variables for seat distribution c...">Party</a> List that the party fixes the order in which the candidates are listed and elected, and the voter simply casts a vote for the party as a whole. The voters are not be able to indicate their preference for any candidates on the list but must accept the list in the order presented by the party. Winning candidates are selected in the exact order they appear on the original list. In this class, we implement the ReadFile function which reads the file information into some corresponding object for <a class="el" href="classCPL.html" title="Closed Party List voting. Inherits VotingType. This voting method votes only to parties. So, Candidate objects will not recieve any votes. Party will recieve the votes instead. This is informed to the Report class for Displaying results. ">CPL</a> voting type. After reading the file, all the inormation are stored in report_. In this class, we implement PopulateVotes() function to count the votes. Also, we use struct sortbypartyvote to sort the order of the vote by comparing the number of votes. Whatever party gets the highest vote, it will appear at the top. Then, we implement the DistributreSeats() to get a total of seats. Also, we sort the priority order of the candidate. We implement Audit() function which counts votes and modify a party list into only containing the winners.</p>

OPL</h1>
<p>OPl stands for Open <a class="el" href="classParty.html" title="A Party mainly holds instances of Candidates. It also contains some variables for seat distribution c...">Party</a> List that voters express a preference for a particular candidate and a party. Each ballot will only have one candidate indicated as choice for the vote. In this class, we use similar method to <a class="el" href="classCPL.html" title="Closed Party List voting. Inherits VotingType. This voting method votes only to parties. So, Candidate objects will not recieve any votes. Party will recieve the votes instead. This is informed to the Report class for Displaying results. ">CPL</a> class.

So, Candidate objects will not recieve any votes. Party will recieve the votes instead. This is informed to the Report class for Displaying results. ">CPL</a>, such as ReadFile(), struct sortbypartyvote, Audit(), DistributeSeats(), and PopulateVotes(). The only different is, we implement struct sortbycandvote in <a class="el" href="classOPL.html" title="Open Party List voting. Inherits VotingSystem. This voting method votes only to Candidates. In turn, Candidates will hold vote individual vote count. Also, parties will also hold a sum vote count by their own candidates. This is done to calculate distribution of seats.
