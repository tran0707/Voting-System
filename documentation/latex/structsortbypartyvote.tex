A structor operator using for sorting function. used by Audit() to compare between 2 pairs (Compare \hyperlink{classParty}{Party} num votes which is the first element). Ascending order. comparing value of First only e.\+g. Comparing $<$123, 456$>$, $<$321, 456$>$ =$>$ sort will call this operator structor and put $<$321, 456$>$ before $<$123, 456$>$
